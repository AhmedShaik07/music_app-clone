# Spotify Clone 🎵

A simple Spotify-inspired music player web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases the basic functionalities of a music player, including play, pause, next, previous, and progress bar updates, along with a dynamic song list.

## Features:
- 🎶 **Dynamic Song List**: Displays a list of songs with their cover images and names.
- ▶️ **Play/Pause Control**: Toggle between play and pause for the current song.
- ⏭️ **Next/Previous Buttons**: Navigate between songs in the playlist.
- 📈 **Progress Bar**: Interactive progress bar to seek within the song.
- 🎛️ **Dynamic Updates**: Updates UI elements dynamically based on the current song and user interactions.
- 🎨 **Responsive Design**: Optimized for different screen sizes using the viewport meta tag.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and dynamic behavior.

## How It Works:
1. The application loads a predefined list of songs with details such as song name, file path, and cover image.
2. Users can play or pause a song using the main play/pause button.
3. The progress bar updates as the song plays and can be used to seek within the song.
4. Users can switch between songs using the next and previous buttons.
5. Clicking on a song from the list dynamically loads and plays it.
